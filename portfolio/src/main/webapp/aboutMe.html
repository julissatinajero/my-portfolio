      <p class = "shortDescription"> Hello! My name is Julissa Tinajero. I am the
          eldest of two daughters and a very proud Latina. I 
          grew up in a small agricultural town located in central   
          California where many immigrants, including my parents,  
          found job opportunities working in the fields. My upbringing
          taught me the value of hard work, dedication, and persistance. 
          Currently, I am attending San Jose State University studying 
          Computer Science. I am the first in my family to go to college,
          and I'm passionate about succeeding in the tech field. My hope is to one 
          day use my experiences to help other young girls like me pursue
          their own goals.
