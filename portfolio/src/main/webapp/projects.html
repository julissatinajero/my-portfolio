                    <p id="proj-description">Imminent Reprisal is a choose-your-own adventure game inspired by Greek mythology! Users are presented with a 
                      series of choices to dictate the protogonist's fate. The game requires users to sign in using a Gmail account in order 
                      to keep track of the attempts, or "lives", the user has left to complete the storyline. <br><br>
